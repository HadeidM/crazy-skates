# Crazy Skates 

## Overview

This is one of my projects from when I took [ART 107](https://guide.wisc.edu/courses/art/) (Introduction to Digital Forms) at UW-Madison. It's a simple interactive art piece that was created with the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. 

The rotating skates in the window is something that I 3D modelled using the [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com/) 3D modelling software. 



To interact with the canvas, you can move your mouse around and the 3D shapes will interact with wherever the mouse lies on the screen.
