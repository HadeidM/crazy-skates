# Rocket Skates 

## Overview

This is one of my projects from when I took [ART 107](https://guide.wisc.edu/courses/art/) (Introduction to Digital Forms) at UW-Madison. It's a simple interactive art piece that was created with the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.  


The rotating skates in the window is something that I 3D modelled using the [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com/) 3D modelling software.

To interact with the canvas, you can move your mouse around and the 3D shapes will interact with wherever the mouse lies on the screen.

<p>Additionally, you can also change the dimensions of the Torus shape using the slider in the bottom left side of the page.</p>

Finally, the canvas adapts to the screen size of the user!
